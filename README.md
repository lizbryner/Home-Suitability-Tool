# Home-Suitability-Tool
This tool was designed to help families find the best places to live when trying to buy a home in Utah. It uses proximity to schools, parks, fire stations, and libraries to then select 20 address points that are the closest to all of these in the selected city.  
The user selects the city they want to live in, and runs the tool. The output is a new layer with 20 address points.
